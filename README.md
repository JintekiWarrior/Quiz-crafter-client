# Quiz Crafter

## Description

I made this web site to show what I can do as a full stack developer. This site is also for teachers that want an easy way to make an online quiz for their students. Users can both make and take quizzes, as well as receive a score after taking the quiz. I learned a lot while making this project such as using react router, crud operations for a one to many relationship in noSQL, and the functionality that goes behind taking an online quiz.
