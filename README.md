# Quiz Crafter

## Description

I made this web site to show what I can do as a full stack developer. This site is also for teachers that want an easy way to make an online quiz for their students. Users can both make and take quizzes, as well as receive a score after taking the quiz. I learned a lot while making this project such as using react router, crud operations for a one to many relationship in noSQL, and the functionality that goes behind taking an online quiz.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
